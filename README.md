# Weather App (Frontend)

![Home Page](/Home.png)

This is the frontend repository for the Weather App project. It provides a user-friendly interface to access weather information for different locations. The Weather App is built using MERN stack, tailwindCSS and open weather API, and it fetches weather data from a [backend API](https://weather-app-2nid.onrender.com).

## Features

- View current weather conditions for a specific location.
- Responsive UI

## Installation

To run the Weather App locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using git clone

2. Install the dependencies using npm install

3. Start the frontend development server using npm start

Else go to https://storied-fairy-45c4af.netlify.app/ to access the live project. Before running the frontend part, I'd like to request you to first run the backend deployed link. This will activate the server instance since it is hosted on a free platform where server instances can go inactive due to inactivity. [backend API](https://weather-app-2nid.onrender.com)
